# ArgentiPokerChallenge

## How to run the app
The solution will need to be built first.
After building, open powershell or the command line in the bin folder that the .exe is built to.
If using powershell, run ```` .\ArgentiPokerChallenge "<full file path>" ```` otherwise in cmd do the same without the '.\\':  ```` ArgentiPokerChallenge "<full file path>" ````.

## Miscellaneous notes
The program assumes that the .txt file contains cards in the correct format as per the poker-hands.txt file provided.
